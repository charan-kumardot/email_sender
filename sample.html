Today the Bodleian Libraries offers visitors a unique experience, combining the antiquity of the Old Library with the modern exhibition space of the Weston Library.<br>

Expert guides bring to life the story of the Library on our behind the scenes tours.  30 Minute Tours include a visit to the Divinity School, a masterpiece of English Gothic architecture, and the medieval Duke Humfrey’s Library, both of which featured in the Harry Potter films.  60 Minute Tours include both of these sites, as well as the Convocation House, recently featured in the Oscar-winning film The Favourite, and Chancellor’s Court.  Extended 90 Minute Tours also visit the iconic Radcliffe Camera, one of Oxford’s most celebrated landmarks.<br>

Self-guided audio tours visiting the Divinity School and Quadrangles are available in English, French, German, Spanish and Mandarin.  These provide a fascinating overview of the Library and University’s history and architecture.<br>

The recently renovated purpose-built Weston Library offers two free-access rotating exhibitions featuring notable works from our collections.Self-guided audio tours visiting the Divinity School and Quadrangles are available in English, French, German, Spanish and Mandarin.
